# VARIOUS.AUTHORS' LÖVE2D Boilerplate

A project I started myself with no other people. Ignore the "forked" thing up top, ZNCatlaw is just one of my many aliases. Some people call me Suzan, too, but that's a story for another time. Basically this is like some kind of structure for LÖVE2D with a bunch of helpful libraries that I wroted.

See [LAYOUT.md](LAYOUT.md) for more info.
